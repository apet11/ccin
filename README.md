Confidential computing is nothing.

This project is a collection of materials about confidential computing, primarily documents and source code. It explains the basic rationale for confidential computing. And for both commercial and technical purposes, confidential computing is nothing. Without a root trust, computing can't be confidential, and big CPU companies can't be the root trust. If your cloud service runs well now, don't worry about the privacy -- even if you pay more for confidential computing features, it won't work better.
